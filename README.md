Cats and Dogs image classification using convolutional neural network.
**Cat and Dog Image Classifier: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project**

**Description:**
Our Cat and Dog Image Classifier utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify images of cats and dogs. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical representations of visual data, making them ideal for distinguishing between different animal species.

**Features:**

1. **Dataset:** We use a large dataset of labeled cat and dog images for training and testing our classifier. This dataset provides a diverse range of images capturing various poses, backgrounds, and breeds of cats and dogs.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network:** Our classifier architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from input images. These features are then flattened and fed into fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Preprocessing:** Prior to training, we preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset with techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming. This helps improve the model's robustness and generalization ability.

4. **Model Training:** The CNN model is trained on the labeled dataset using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization. We employ techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.

5. **Evaluation:** We evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test set, measuring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess the classifier's effectiveness in distinguishing between cats and dogs.

6. **Deployment:** After achieving satisfactory performance, we deploy the trained model into a practical application or web service. Users can upload images of cats or dogs and receive real-time predictions on their classification.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Prepare the dataset by downloading and organizing cat and dog images into respective folders.
3. Follow the setup instructions in the documentation to install dependencies and configure the environment.
4. Train the CNN model using provided scripts or notebooks, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation scripts and visualize results.
6. Deploy the image classifier according to deployment instructions for real-world usage.
